# Matrix Operations and Linear Systems with Python

This repository contains Python scripts and notes covering essential matrix operations, linear systems, and computational methods. The goal is to progress from fundamental matrix arithmetic to using matrices for solving systems of equations, with a final step toward computational methods for larger matrices.

> **Note:** The core mathematical definitions and examples in this README are derived from the accompanying **Notes.rtf** source file in the root directory.

## üìê 2. Intro to Matrices (`/matrixIntro`)

This section introduces what a matrix is, how to reference its elements, and provides an example of visualization.

### Basic Concepts

A matrix is an array of numbers organized into rows and columns.

* **Example Matrix A** (2 rows, 3 columns, or $2 \times 3$, where $\text{R} \times \text{C}$):
    $$\text{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 7 & -4 \\ 6 & 3 & 5 \end{bmatrix}$$
* **Order (Dimensions):** The order of a matrix is simply the rows and columns. The matrix above would be a **$2 \times 3$** matrix.
* **Square Matrices:** Square matrices are matrices where the number rows and columns are the same.
    $$\text{C} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$
* **Indexing:** Indexing into a matrix is similar to indexing into arrays in programming. Element $A_{2,3}$ (Row 2, Column 3) would be 5.

### Files in `matrixIntro/`

* **`matrixVisualization.py`**: This file shows a basic way to visualize matrices in Python.
* **`basicConcepts.py`**: This file provides an explanation of basic matrix concepts.

## ‚ûï 3. Basic Matrix Operations (`/basicMatrixOperations`)

This folder gives some background on matrix addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication.

### 3.1. Adding and Subtracting

To add or subtract, simply add or subtract the elements in the same positions. **You cannot add or subtract matrices with different dimensions**.

$$\text{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 7 & -4 \\ 6 & 3 & 5 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{B} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 & 5 \\ -7 & 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$$

* **Addition:**
    $$\text{A} + \text{B} = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 8 & 1 \\ -1 & 7 & 7 \end{bmatrix}$$
* **Subtraction:**
    $$\text{A} - \text{B} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 6 & -9 \\ 13 & -1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$

### 3.2. Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication of matrices involves multiplying every entry in a matrix by a single real number, called a **scalar**. This changes the magnitude of each element without altering the matrix's dimensions.

$$\text{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & -2 \\ 7 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{B} = \begin{bmatrix} -4 & 6 \\ -2 & 9 \end{bmatrix}$$

* **Example: Find 3A**
    $$3\text{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 15 & -6 \\ 21 & 9 \end{bmatrix}$$
* **Combined Operations (e.g., 5A - 6B):**
    $$\text{5A} - \text{6B} = \begin{bmatrix} 49 & -46 \\ 47 & -39 \end{bmatrix}$$
