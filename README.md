## üìÇ Repository Structure

The project is organized into six main folders, each containing Python files (`.py`) dedicated to a specific mathematical or programming concept.

### 1. `pythonBasics/`
* **Purpose:** Foundational files to introduce core Python syntax and control flow necessary for matrix programming.
* **Key Files:**
    * `introToPython.py`: Basic Python syntax and concepts.
    * `forLoopsInPython.py`: Covers the use of `for` loops, a critical tool for matrix iteration.

### 2. `matrixIntro/`
* **Purpose:** Defines the matrix data structure, its properties, and terminology.
* **Key Files:**
    * `basicConcepts.py`: Definitions of matrix terminology (rows, columns, order, square matrices).
    * `matrixVisualization.py`: Shows a basic method for visualizing or displaying matrices in Python.

### 3. `basicMatrixOperations/`
* **Purpose:** Scripts for implementing the simplest matrix arithmetic operations.
* **Key Files:**
    * `additionAndSubtraction.py`: Implementation of matrix addition and subtraction (requires matrices of the same dimension).
    * `scalarMultiplication.py`: Implementation of scaling a matrix by a single real number (a scalar).

### 4. `advancedMatrixOperations/`
* **Purpose:** Focuses on the more complex operation that forms the basis for solving linear systems.
* **Key Files:**
    * `multiplyingMatrices.py`: Implementation of standard matrix-by-matrix multiplication.

### 5. `solvingSystemsAndInverses/`
* **Purpose:** Core focus of the unit‚Äîusing matrices to solve systems of linear equations.
* **Key Files:**
    * `solveLinearSystem.py`: Main script for solving linear systems using matrix methods.
    * `matrixInverse.py`: Calculation of the matrix inverse, a tool for solving systems.
    * `calculateDeterminant.py`: Calculation of the determinant, used for finding the inverse and determining system solvability.

### 6. `applicationsAndComputation/`
* **Purpose:** Moves beyond pure theory to practical use and large-scale computation.
* **Key Files:**
    * `matrixApplications.py`: Demonstrates simple, real-world applications of matrix algebra.
    * `largeMatrixComputation.py`: Introduces methods and libraries (like NumPy) for working with large matrices efficiently.
